# Calculation of Learning Assessment Metrics

## **About the Project**
The **Calculation of Learning Assessment Metrics** project aims to evaluate the performance of machine learning models using various classification metrics. It calculates Sensitivity (Recall), Accuracy, Precision, F1-Score, and generates a **Confusion Matrix** and **ROC Curve** to analyze the model's performance.

This project is implemented in **Google Colab** and follows the standard evaluation metrics used in supervised learning algorithms.

## **üõ† Model and Dataset**
- **Dataset**: Confusion Matrix simulation based on model predictions.
- **Model**: Pre-trained classification model (e.g., Cats vs. Dogs).
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras.
- **Objective**: Calculate key classification metrics and analyze the model's performance.
- **Environment**: Google Colab.

## Download the Pre-trained Model

Due to GitHub's file size limits, the trained model is hosted on Google Drive. You can download it from the link below:

**[Download modelo_treinado.keras](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dJ1l0xfFzXnR-7zjWKbD71WM8tGxVQQ6/view?usp=sharing)**

After downloading, place the file in the `./models/` folder.

## **Installation**
To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/Calculation-of-Learning-Assessment-Metrics.git
cd Calculation-of-Learning-Assessment-Metrics
```

## **Implemented Metrics**
The project calculates the following evaluation metrics:

### **Sensitivity (Recall)**  
\[
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\]  
- Measures the ability to correctly classify positive samples.

### **Accuracy**  
\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
\]  
- Measures overall correctness of the model.

### **Precision**  
\[
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
\]  
- Measures how many predicted positives are actually correct.

### **F1-Score**  
\[
F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\]  
- Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

### **Confusion Matrix**
- A table used to evaluate the performance of the classification model.

### **ROC Curve**
- Graphically represents the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

## **Problems Faced and Solutions**
 **Data Imbalance**  
- Balanced the dataset by ensuring equal representation of classes.  

 **Misclassification of Certain Classes**  
- Fine-tuned the model and adjusted the decision threshold.

 **Threshold Selection in Binarization**  
- Experimented with different thresholds to optimize performance.

 **Variations in Accuracy Across Datasets**  
- Conducted multiple tests with different datasets to assess generalization.

## **Technologies Used**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For model evaluation and metric calculations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training metrics and ROC curves.
- **NumPy**: For handling array computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For generating the confusion matrix and ROC curve.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based environment for execution with GPU support.
